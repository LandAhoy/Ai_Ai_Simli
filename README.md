# Simli_personal_avatar
Create your own personal avatar for Zoom or Discord chats or even live streaming...

1.  Run Server.py in your terminal for the backend API
3.  Launch Index.html for the front end

What I do is use OBS to set up a virtual camera of the Pip of the avatar so I can join zoom etc...
